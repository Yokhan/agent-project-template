# Codex API Contract

Read `.claude/skills/api-contract/SKILL.md` and `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` when present.

## Process

1. Treat the contract as the source of truth.
2. Compare implementation, tests, generated types, and docs.
3. Identify breaking versus non-breaking changes.
4. Prefer typed schemas and Structured Outputs where applicable.
5. Add contract tests for public API changes.
6. Update `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` or `docs/openapi.yaml` when behavior changes.
